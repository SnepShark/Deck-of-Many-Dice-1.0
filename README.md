# Deck-of-Many-Dice-1.0

https://snepshark.itch.io/deck-of-many-dice

This repo (and the full release) are a work in progress! The manual in particular is incomplete, but if you're interested in modifying the deck, this should be a bit less cluttered than the private repo (and the deck should now compile on other people's machines)

I'll add license information soon. For now, check the Itch page for that.
